FlatDOM
===
## What is it
This is a module for manipulating HTML/XML DOM using server-side JavaScript (Node.js). 

## Motivation
A simple representation of DOM objects (as a flat array) makes it much easier to view and manipulate data. The motivation behind this project is to provide an easy and fast way to find elements within DOM and make it easy to import/export different representations of the DOM data.
